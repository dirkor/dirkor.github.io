This study aims to develop an ontology model as a knowledge base for the development of a university information service system. Ontology development, in general, consists of key processes such as determining the knowledge domain, conceptualizing the knowledge domain, and transforming the conceptual model from the ontology into a formal model. In this study, the concept of the development model uses the METHONTOLOGY framework as a reference in ontology development. Several development stages include defining a glossary of terms, taxonomy concepts, relations, and attributes.
